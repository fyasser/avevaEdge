# AvevaEdge Dashboard Application

## Overview
The AvevaEdge Dashboard Application is a web-based platform designed to visualize and interact with industrial or operational data. It provides real-time updates, interactive charts, and filtering options to help users monitor and analyze system performance effectively.

---

## Features

### Frontend
- **Dashboard Layout**: Includes a sidebar, top bar, and main content area for charts and data tables.
- **Data Visualization**: Supports line charts, scatter plots, doughnut charts, and bar charts.
- **Filters and Aggregation**: Allows users to filter data by date range, thresholds, and aggregation levels.
- **Data Table**: Displays raw data with search, pagination, sorting capabilities, and comprehensive insights for key metrics including flow, pressure, fluid state, and noise levels.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Uses Socket.IO to fetch and display new data dynamically.
- **Dark Mode**: Provides a toggle for light and dark themes.
- **Report Generation**: Generates and downloads HTML reports of the dashboard state.

### Backend
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a SQL Server database to fetch and filter data.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Uses Socket.IO to send real-time updates to the frontend.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful APIs for fetching filtered data and generating reports.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for database and API operations.
- **Polling Mechanism**: Periodically checks for new data and emits updates to connected clients.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Install the latest version.
- **SQL Server**: Ensure a running instance with the required database.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Aveva
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration
- Update the database connection settings in `backend/server.js`.
- Ensure the SQL Server database is accessible with the provided credentials.

### Running the Application
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Metrics Tracked

The AvevaEdge Dashboard monitors and analyzes several critical operational metrics:

- **Flow (mÂ³/h)**: Measures the volume of fluid moving through the system per hour.
- **Pressure (kPa)**: Tracks the pressure levels within the system in kilopascals.
- **System Fluid State**: A composite metric representing the overall state of the fluid system on a scale of 0-100.
- **Noise (dB)**: Measures acoustic emissions from the system, which can indicate mechanical issues or abnormal operation.

Each metric includes detailed analysis with statistical summaries, trend identification, and correlation analysis to help identify issues and optimize system performance.

## Usage
- **Filters**: Apply filters to refine data displayed in charts and tables.
- **Real-Time Updates**: View live data updates without refreshing the page.
- **Report Generation**: Generate and download reports for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - **Enhanced Data Table**: View comprehensive metrics and insights for flow, pressure, system fluid state, and noise levels.
  - **Metric Summaries**: Access statistical summaries including averages, minimums, and maximums for all key metrics.
  - **Trend Analysis**: View trend indicators showing whether metrics are rising, falling, or stable.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze relationships between different metrics like flow-pressure and noise-flow correlations.
  - **Column Customization**: Show/hide columns as needed for focused analysis.
  - **Time Aggregation**: Aggregate data by minute, day, or month for trend identification.

---

## API Endpoints
- **`GET /api/trend-data`**: Fetches filtered data from the database.
- **`POST /generate-report`**: Initiates report generation.
- **`GET /`**: Test route to verify database connection.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Database Connection Issues**: Check the SQL Server configuration and credentials in `server.js`.
- **Frontend Not Loading**: Ensure the backend server is running and accessible.
- **Real-Time Updates Not Working**: Verify Socket.IO is correctly configured and not blocked by firewalls.
